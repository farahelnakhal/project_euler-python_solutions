# Project Euler â€” Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, implemented in different languages. Each problem explores mathematical reasoning, algorithms, and efficient coding techniques.

---

Each problem solution is stored in its own folder named `problem_<NNN>`. A folder may contain solutions in one or more programming languages.

Each solution file follows this naming convention: `problem_<NNN>.<ext>`

For example, the Python solution for Problem 1 would be: `problem_001.py`.
