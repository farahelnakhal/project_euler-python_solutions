# Project Euler — Solutions

This repository contains my solutions to [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) problems, all implemented in Python. Each problem explores mathematical reasoning, algorithms, and efficient coding techniques.

---

Each file follows the naming format:  
`problem_<NNN>.py` → for example, for problem 1, `problem_001.py`.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.8 or higher  
- No external libraries needed unless noted in a specific file.

---

## Running a Solution
Run any problem file with:
```bash
python3 problem_001.py
